# Billing & Pricing

## Model
- **Internal pilot**: No billing (covered by platform budget).
- **Future external offering**:
  - Per-seat subscription (monthly/annual).
  - Add-on pricing for premium AI providers.
  - Optional managed hosting fees.

## Payment processing
- Use Stripe Billing for subscription management.
- Support invoices/pay-by-wire for enterprise accounts.

## Reporting
- Monthly report of active seats, AI usage, storage consumption.
- Export billing data via `/admin/billing/export`.

## Roadmap
- Integrate metered billing for AI tokens (post-MVP).
- Evaluate self-host licensing.

> Coordinate with finance for pricing experiments before GA.
