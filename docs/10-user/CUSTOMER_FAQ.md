# User FAQ

**How do I sign in?**  
Use the email you registered with and request a magic link. You can also connect Google and sign in via OAuth.

**Can I connect multiple email accounts?**  
Yes. Go to **Settings → Connectors** and add additional accounts (Google supported first).

**Where are my emails stored?**  
Emails are stored securely in our MongoDB cluster within your selected region. Attachments live in encrypted object storage.

**How do AI summaries work?**  
AI summarizes threads using the configured provider. Summaries are cached and never shared externally beyond the provider selected.

**I sent an email but it’s stuck in pending state.**  
Check the activity log. If the SMTP relay is unavailable, the app retries up to 3 times. Contact your admin if issues persist.

**Can I export my data?**  
Yes. Request an export under **Settings → Privacy**. You’ll receive a download link within 24 hours.

**Who do I contact for support?**  
Email `support@yourdomain` or file a ticket in the internal helpdesk. For critical incidents, follow on-call escalation.
